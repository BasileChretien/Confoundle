    "A 和 B 治疗的并不是同一批患者。A 主要接手了疑难病例（大结石），而 B 主要接手了容易的病例。所有人在疑难病例上的表现都更差，因此即便 A 在每个组里都胜出，它的总体平均值仍被拉低：",
  "Simpson's paradox": "辛普森悖论",
  "An overall trend can reverse once you account for a lurking variable that's split unevenly between the groups.":
    "一旦把在各组之间分布不均的潜在变量考虑进来，总体趋势就可能发生反转。",
  "Whenever two groups are compared with one pooled rate, ask what got mixed together to make that number, and whether the groups were even up against the same odds. Stone size is the clearest confounder here; it's rarely the only one.":
    "每当用一个合并后的比率来比较两个组时，都要问一问：这个数字是把哪些东西混在一起算出来的，以及两个组面对的胜算是否真的一样。结石大小是这里最明显的混杂因素，但它很少是唯一的。",
  "The 'combined' score isn't a fresh measurement; it's the group scores blended together, and bigger groups count for more. When one side is packed with easy cases and the other with hard ones, that blend pulls their combined scores in opposite directions. So one option can lead in the easy group and in the hard group, yet still trail overall, because it handled most of the hard cases, and its blended score sits closer to that lower number. The cure is a fair split: give both sides the same mix of easy and hard cases (exactly what a randomised trial does), and the reversal can't happen.":
    "“合并”得分并不是一次全新的测量，而是把各组的得分混合在一起，而且组越大权重越高。当一方全是容易的病例、另一方全是疑难的病例时，这种混合会把它们的合并得分拉向相反的方向。于是，一个方案可以在容易组和疑难组中都领先，却仍然在总体上落后，因为它处理了大部分疑难病例，其混合后的得分更接近那个较低的数字。解决办法是公平地划分：给双方相同比例的容易与疑难病例（这正是随机对照试验所做的事），反转就不可能发生。",

  "In 1973, Berkeley's graduate schools admitted 44% of men but only 35% of women. It looked like plain bias. Yet department by department, women were admitted at about the same rate as men, or higher. Women simply applied more often to the most competitive departments, where almost everyone was turned away. The gap was about where people applied, not who was deciding.":
    "1973 年，伯克利的研究生院录取了 44% 的男性申请者，却只录取了 35% 的女性申请者。这看起来就是赤裸裸的偏见。然而逐个院系来看，女性的录取率与男性大致相当，甚至更高。原因只是女性更多地申请了竞争最激烈的院系，而那些院系几乎人人被拒。差距在于人们申请了哪里，而不在于是谁在做决定。",

Each single year said Justice; the two years together said Jeter, because the players had very different numbers of at-bats in their strong and weak seasons.":
    "1995 年，大卫·贾斯蒂斯的打击率高于德里克·基特（0.253 对 0.250），1996 年再次领先（0.321 对 0.314）。但把两个赛季合起来看，反而是基特胜出，0.310 对 0.270。单看每一年都是贾斯蒂斯占优，两年合起来却是基特占优，因为两名球员在各自的强势赛季和低迷赛季里打数相差悬殊。",
  "COVID-19 death rates": "COVID-19 死亡率",
  "Early in 2020, the reported death rate among COVID cases was higher in Italy than in China overall. But broken down by age, Italy's rate was lower in every age group. Italy simply had far more older patients, who are at higher risk, so pooling all ages together made Italy look worse than a fair, age-for-age comparison showed.":
    "2020 年初，在 COVID 病例中，意大利报告的总体死亡率高于中国。但按年龄段拆分后，意大利在每一个年龄段的死亡率都更低。原因只是意大利的老年患者多得多，而老年人风险更高，因此把所有年龄段合在一起，就让意大利显得比按同龄对比更糟。",
  "Simpson's paradox, a reasoning trap.":
    "辛普森悖论，一个推理陷阱。",
  "One choice can win in every single group, yet lose the moment you lump all the groups together. It sounds impossible, but it's real. It happens when the groups aren't a fair comparison: one side quietly got the easy cases, the other got the hard ones. So the big combined number says one thing while the group-by-group numbers say the opposite, and it's the big number that fools you.":
    "一个选项可以在每一个单独的组里都获胜，却在你把所有组合并到一起的那一刻输掉。这听起来不可能，但确实存在。它出现在各组并非公平比较的时候：一方悄悄拿到了容易的病例，另一方拿到了疑难的病例。于是，那个庞大的合并数字说的是一回事，而逐组的数字说的却正好相反，真正骗到你的正是那个大数字。",

  "A near-perfect test says you're sick. How worried should you be?":
    "一项近乎完美的检测说你病了。你到底该有多担心？",
  "This disease is rare, about 1 in 1,000 people have it. The test never misses it when it's really there, and it raises a false alarm on only about 1 in 20 healthy people. Your result just came back positive.":
    "这种疾病很罕见，大约每 1,000 人中只有 1 人患病。当疾病确实存在时，检测从不漏诊；而对健康人，它大约每 20 人才误报 1 次。你的结果刚刚显示为阳性。",
  "What's the chance you actually have the disease?":
    "你真正患病的概率有多大？",
  "In 1,000 people": "在 1,000 人中",
  "have the disease": "患病",
  "test positive": "检测呈阳性",
  "About 95%": "大约 95%",
  "the test is 95% accurate": "这项检测有 95% 的准确率",
  "About half": "大约一半",
  "50/50": "五五开",
  "About 2%": "大约 2%",
  "roughly 1 in 50": "大约每 50 人中 1 人",
  "Positive, but almost certainly a false alarm.":
    "阳性，但几乎可以肯定是一次误报。",
  "The base rate": "基础概率",
  "A rare disease flips the odds":
    "罕见的疾病会颠覆概率",
  "Because almost nobody has the disease, the test's small error rate does the heavy lifting. In 1,000 people, only 1 is truly sick, but about 50 healthy people also get a positive. So among the ~51 positive results, just 1 is real. A positive barely nudges you from “very unlikely” to “still unlikely.”":
    "因为几乎没有人真正患病，检测那一点点的错误率就起了决定性作用。在 1,000 人中，只有 1 人真正患病，但大约 50 名健康人也会得到阳性结果。所以在约 51 个阳性结果中，只有 1 个是真的。一个阳性结果只是把你从“极不可能”勉强推到“仍然不太可能”而已。",
  "The base-rate fallacy": "基础概率谬误",
  "When something is rare, even a very accurate test throws up far more false alarms than real cases, so a positive result can still mean you're probably fine.":
    "当一件事很罕见时，即便是非常准确的检测，产生的误报也远多于真正的病例，因此一个阳性结果仍然可能意味着你大概没事。",
  "The fix is to think in whole people, not percentages: picture 1,000 of them, count the true positives and the false alarms, and compare. Always ask how common the thing is before you trust a positive.":
    "解决办法是用具体的人数来思考，而不是用百分比：想象 1,000 个人，数一数真阳性和误报，然后作比较。在相信一个阳性结果之前，永远先问一问这件事有多常见。",
  "A test's accuracy and your actual odds are two different things. Accuracy is measured on people we already know are sick or healthy. But a positive result asks the reverse question (given this positive, am I sick?), and that depends on how many sick people there were to find in the first place. If only 1 in 1,000 has the disease, the huge healthy majority produces a flood of false alarms that swamps the single real case. Make the disease common and the same test looks excellent; make it rare and a positive means little on its own.":
    "检测的准确率和你的真实概率是两回事。准确率是在我们已经知道谁健康、谁患病的人群上测出来的。但一个阳性结果问的是反过来的问题（既然结果是阳性，我到底病了没有？），而这取决于一开始究竟有多少患者可供检出。如果每 1,000 人中只有 1 人患病，庞大的健康多数就会制造出大量误报，把那唯一的真实病例彻底淹没。让这种病变得常见，同一项检测就显得非常出色；让它变得罕见，单凭一个阳性结果就说明不了什么。",
  "Even doctors slip": "连医生也会出错",
  "Researchers put this exact question to doctors and medical staff: a disease in 1 in 1,000, a test with a 5% false-alarm rate. The most common answer was 95%. The average was 56%. Only about 1 in 5 gave the correct answer of roughly 2%.":
    "研究者把这个完全相同的问题拿去问医生和医护人员：一种每 1,000 人中有 1 人患病的疾病，一项误报率为 5% 的检测。最常见的回答是 95%。平均答案是 56%。只有大约五分之一的人给出了大约 2% 这个正确答案。",
  "Think in people, not percentages":
    "用人数思考，而不是百分比",
  "The simplest cure is wording. Pose the same problem in natural frequencies (“1 in 1,000 people” and “about 50 false alarms” rather than “0.1%” and “5%”), and far more people, doctors included, get it right.":
    "最简单的解药是换一种表述。用自然频率来提出同一个问题（说“每 1,000 人中有 1 人”和“大约 50 次误报”，而不是“0.1%”和“5%”），会有多得多的人，包括医生在内，答对它。",
  "The base-rate fallacy, a reasoning trap.":
    "基础概率谬误，一个推理陷阱。",
  "A test can be 95% accurate and a positive result can still mean you're almost certainly fine. The trick is how rare the thing is. If only 1 in 1,000 people have a disease, then among everyone who tests positive, the few real cases are buried under a pile of false alarms. Accuracy isn't the same as your actual odds; you have to ask how common it is first.":
    "一项检测可以有 95% 的准确率，而一个阳性结果仍然可能意味着你几乎肯定没事。关键在于这件事有多罕见。如果每 1,000 人中只有 1 人患病，那么在所有检测呈阳性的人当中，寥寥几个真实病例会被埋在一大堆误报之下。准确率并不等于你的真实概率，你得先问一问它到底有多常见。",

    "这是一项真实而且已发表的发现：在 23 个国家里，人们吃的巧克力越多，这个国家产生的诺贝尔奖得主就越多，二者呈强相关（r ≈ 0.79）。这个趋势很难反驳。",
  "So, does eating chocolate help win Nobel Prizes?":
    "那么，吃巧克力有助于赢得诺贝尔奖吗？",
  "Across 23 countries": "在 23 个国家中",
  "Chocolate eaten": "巧克力消费量",
  "Nobel prizes": "诺贝尔奖",
  "A country's wealth": "国家的财富",
  "r ≈ 0.79": "r ≈ 0.79",
  "Yes, chocolate boosts brainpower":
    "是的，巧克力能提升脑力",
  "the trend is strong": "趋势很明显",
  "No, it's a pure fluke": "不，纯属侥幸巧合",
  coincidence: "巧合",
  "No, a third thing drives both":
    "不，有第三个因素同时驱动两者",
  "a common cause": "一个共同原因",
  "The chocolate isn't doing anything.": "巧克力其实什么作用都没有。",
  "The common cause": "共同原因",
  "A country's wealth pulls both up":
    "国家的财富把两者一同拉高",
  "Wealthier countries can afford more chocolate AND fund more universities, labs and research, which is what actually wins Nobel Prizes. Wealth drives both, so chocolate and Nobels rise together without one causing the other. Hand out free chocolate and you'd get sweeter teeth, not more laureates.":
    "更富裕的国家既买得起更多巧克力，也能资助更多大学、实验室和科研，而后者才是真正赢得诺贝尔奖的原因。财富同时驱动着两者，于是巧克力和诺贝尔奖一起上升，却并非谁导致了谁。免费发放巧克力，你只会收获更甜的牙齿，而不是更多的获奖者。",
  "Correlation ≠ causation": "相关性 ≠ 因果性",
  "Two things moving together doesn't mean one causes the other. Often a third thing is quietly driving both.":
    "两件事一起变化，并不意味着其中一个导致了另一个。往往是第三个因素在悄悄驱动着两者。",
  "When you see a strong link, run through the possibilities before believing X causes Y: maybe Y causes X, maybe a common cause drives both, or maybe it's chance. Usually only a controlled comparison can tell which.":
    "当你看到一个很强的关联时，先把各种可能性都过一遍，再去相信 X 导致了 Y：也许是 Y 导致了 X，也许有一个共同原因同时驱动着两者，也许只是偶然。通常只有一次对照比较才能分辨究竟是哪一种。",
  "A correlation only says two things tend to move together. That can happen for several reasons: one really does cause the other; the causation runs the other way; a hidden third factor drives both (a common cause, like hot weather driving both ice-cream sales and drownings); or it's a coincidence, which gets more likely the more data you sift through. Spotting a correlation is the easy part. Working out which of these is behind it is the real job, and usually needs an experiment, not just a chart.":
    "相关性只说明两件事倾向于一起变化。这可能有好几种原因：一个确实导致了另一个；因果方向恰好相反；一个隐藏的第三因素同时驱动着两者（一个共同原因，比如炎热的天气同时推高了冰淇淋销量和溺水人数）；或者纯属巧合，而你筛查的数据越多，出现巧合的可能性就越大。发现相关性是容易的部分。弄清楚背后究竟是哪一种，才是真正的工作，而这通常需要一次实验，而不只是一张图表。",
  "Storks and babies": "鹳鸟与婴儿",
  "Across European countries, the ones with more storks really do have more human births, a statistically significant link. The legend isn't true: larger countries simply have room for both more storks and more people.":
    "在欧洲各国里，鹳鸟越多的国家，人类新生儿确实也越多，二者的关联在统计上是显著的。但那个传说并不成立：面积更大的国家不过是既能容纳更多鹳鸟，也能容纳更多人口罢了。",
  "Nicolas Cage and drownings": "尼古拉斯·凯奇与溺水",
  "The number of films Nicolas Cage releases in a year tracks the number of people who drown in swimming pools. Nobody thinks one causes the other; line up enough unrelated trends and some will match by pure chance.":
    "尼古拉斯·凯奇一年里上映的电影数量，与在游泳池溺水的人数走势相吻合。没有人会认为其中一个导致了另一个；只要把足够多互不相关的趋势排在一起，总有一些会纯粹出于偶然而对上。",
  "Correlation ≠ causation, a reasoning trap.":
    "相关性 ≠ 因果性，一个推理陷阱。",
  "Two things can rise and fall together perfectly and still have nothing to do with each other. Very often a hidden third thing is pulling both strings at once, so it looks like one causes the other when neither does. Before you believe a headline that “X is linked to Y,” ask what else could be driving both.":
    "两件事可以完美地同涨同跌，却依然彼此毫无关系。很多时候，是一个隐藏的第三者在同时牵动着两根线，于是看起来像是一个导致了另一个，其实二者都没有。在你相信“X 与 Y 相关”这样的标题之前，先问一问还有什么可能在同时驱动着两者。",

  "Bombers come home riddled with bullet holes. Where do you add the armour?":
    "轰炸机满身弹孔地飞回来。你会把装甲加在哪里？",
  "In WWII, returning bombers were peppered with damage, heaviest on the wings and body, while the engines and cockpit came back almost untouched. Armour is heavy, so you can only reinforce a few areas.":
    "二战期间，返航的轰炸机布满了损伤，机翼和机身最为严重，而发动机和驾驶舱几乎毫发无损。装甲很重，所以你只能加固少数几个部位。",
  "Where should the armour go?": "装甲应该加在哪里？",

  "The missing planes": "那些没能返航的飞机",
  "You only see the survivors": "你只看到了幸存者",
  "These are the planes that made it home. The ones hit in the engine or cockpit didn't, so their damage never shows up in the data. The holes on the survivors map out exactly where a bomber can be shot and still fly. The clean spots are the fatal ones: armour those.":
    "这些是成功飞回家的飞机。那些在发动机或驾驶舱中弹的飞机没能回来，所以它们的损伤从未出现在数据里。幸存者身上的弹孔恰好标出了一架轰炸机在哪里中弹仍能继续飞行。那些干净、没有弹孔的部位才是致命的：要加固的正是它们。",
  "Survivorship bias": "幸存者偏差",
  "When you only look at the winners, the failures become invisible, and they often hold the real lesson.":
    "当你只盯着赢家看时，失败者就变得隐形了，而真正的教训往往就藏在他们身上。",
  "Before drawing a conclusion, ask who's missing from the data. The planes that didn't return, the funds that closed, the businesses that folded: they were quietly filtered out, and putting them back can flip the answer.":
    "在得出结论之前，先问一问数据里少了谁。那些没有返航的飞机、那些已经清盘的基金、那些倒闭的企业：它们被悄悄地筛掉了，而把它们放回来，答案可能就此翻转。",
  "Survivorship bias creeps in whenever your data has quietly been filtered to keep only the things that “made it”: returning planes, funds still trading, companies still around. You never see the ones that failed and dropped out, and because the survivors share whatever helped them survive, that trait looks far more common, or more effective, than it really is. The fix is to hunt for the missing group and ask what the full picture would show. (The real Wald did more than point at a diagram: he built a statistical method to estimate each part's vulnerability from the survivors' damage.)":
    "只要你的数据被悄悄筛选，只留下那些“挺过来的”东西，幸存者偏差就会悄然潜入：返航的飞机、仍在交易的基金、依然存续的公司。你从来看不到那些失败并出局的对象，而由于幸存者都共有着某种帮助它们存活下来的特质，这一特质就显得比实际上要普遍得多，或者有效得多。解决办法是去寻找那个缺失的群体，并追问完整的图景会呈现出什么。（真实的沃德所做的远不止指着一张图：他建立了一套统计方法，从幸存者的损伤反推出每个部位的脆弱程度。）",
  "Falling cats": "坠落的猫",
  "Vets found that cats falling from higher floors often arrived with fewer injuries than those from lower floors. Part of the reason is grim survivorship: a cat that didn't survive the fall was never brought in, so the hospital's data only counts the ones that lived.":
    "兽医发现，从更高楼层坠落的猫，送来时的伤情往往比从较低楼层坠落的猫更轻。原因之一是一种残酷的幸存者效应：没能从坠落中活下来的猫根本不会被送来，所以医院的数据只统计了那些活下来的。",
  "Star mutual funds": "明星共同基金",
  "Look at the funds still on offer today and active management looks great. But funds that did badly get quietly closed and dropped from the records, so the survivors flatter the whole industry. Counting the dead funds cuts the average return by over a percentage point a year.":
    "只看今天仍在发售的基金，主动管理看起来棒极了。但那些业绩糟糕的基金被悄悄清盘、从记录中剔除，于是幸存者美化了整个行业。把那些已经消失的基金也算进来，平均年回报率会下降一个百分点以上。",
  "Survivorship bias, a reasoning trap.":
    "幸存者偏差，一个推理陷阱。",
  "It's easy to study the winners, the survivors, the successes, the things still standing, and copy what they have in common. But the failures are invisible: they dropped out of the data. Whatever helped the survivors survive looks far more powerful than it is, because you never see everyone it didn't save. Before copying the winners, ask who's missing.":
    "研究赢家、幸存者、成功案例、那些依然屹立的事物，并去模仿它们的共同点，是很容易的。但失败者是隐形的：他们已经从数据里消失了。任何帮助幸存者存活下来的东西，看上去都比实际上强大得多，因为你从来看不到所有那些它没能拯救的对象。在模仿赢家之前，先问一问少了谁。",
